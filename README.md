Design and Implementation of Asynchronous FIFO | Self Project
◦ Designed an Asynchronous FIFO using Verilog and simulated it using Modelsim.
◦ Gray Code encoding is used for inter-clock domain data transfer to avoid multi-bit signal transitions.
◦ Implemented Two Flip-Flop Synchronizer to avoid meta-stability issues in CDC.
